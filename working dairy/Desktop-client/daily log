Today our group arranged the first meeting for planning the project in the next two months. During the first two weeks, our main task is to illustrate the detailed functions aiming to achieve and be prepared for the initial report as well as the presentation. After finding enough materials, I need to start to learn Java, which might not be so difficult since it is similar to C++.

2017.1.24
My friend recommend me a very useful book about Java programming written in Chinese. There are lots of practical examples which are worth reading.

2017.1.25
Today I talked with Zhiyi and decided the development platform. Our main aim is to develop a desktop application based on Java design and similar to the web QQ. Tomorrow I need to learn about an example about the chatroom from the book Java Design.

2017.1.26
The example about the chatroom service is a little bit confusing. I have downloaded the eclipse and build the Java environment to test the code on the textbook trying to get better understanding.

2017.1.27
Learning more definitions by google is still not that helpful for understanding the code of the example. I decided to give up that and found more examples from github. Tomorrow I need to discuss with my tutor.

2017.1.30
In today’s meeting, we first discussed about the main content of the initial report. Everyone will need to write about the functions as well as the relative solutions, and the difficulties that might encounter. We also specified the work plan and the timetable which indicated lacking of time. Tomorrow I will discuss with Zhiyi about the details of the desktop part.

2017.1.31
Today despite the normal exercise of Java, the interface and the basic functions of the desktop part were determined.

2017.2.1
Focus on the report.

2017.2.2
I still haven’t finish the report and only learn few pages of the java book. Kind of annoyed by the client socket connection.

2017.2.3
Today I have finished the report and we had a group meeting about the presentation. This weekend we will focus on the presentation part and get ready before next Monday.

2017.2.6
On today’s meeting we mainly prepare the presentation and finished the ppt after the discussion.

2017.2.7
Find an interesting resource on Github. Final check about the initial report as well as the ppt. Get ready of the presentation.

2017.2.8
Finished the presentation today. I think Dr. Tratt encourages us to think more about the peer assessment because he thought the task distribution needs to be more detailed. Tomorrow I will discuss the detailed functions that the application should be accomplished.

2017.2.9
After the discussion with Zhiyi, we determined the components and the more detailed functions. But all of these description needs to be written into a document to follow and modify during the development.

2017.2.10
Start to think about more specific description about the user interfaces. Need to be settled down during the weekends.

2017/2/13
Today, I started to design and write the processes of the desktop client application.

2017/2/14
Designed login interface and determined what components need and what functions it achieved.

2017/2/15
I download the eclipse and build the JAVA environment for running.
Anything is all right.

2017/2/16
I build the project and start to write the code of user interface. The class, swing components--JFrame, JPanel, JLabel, JTextField, JButton...
The problem:layout, all labels are layout in order unless it exceed the size of main frame.

2017/2/17
Debug...
Problem: there is no events on every button, I should add the actions for these buttons.

2017/2/20
Added some events for the buttons like login, forgotten and register.
Problem: when users click the login button, the connection with server should be started that means TCP protocol should be established.

2017/2/21
I tested and finished the code of login interface, including the texts of username and password, some buttons.

2017/2/22
I started to layout for the components on interface.

2017.2.23
Today’s main task is to review the work and fix bugs. Hope on weekend we could finish this part.

2017.2.24
The basic login interface is done. Start to search for information of the friend list part on weekend.
